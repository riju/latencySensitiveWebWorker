## Introduction
[Web Workers](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html#workers) enable multithreading in web browsers. By offloading compute-intensive workload to worker threads, we can achieve better UI smoothness and responsiveness. Till now, we have been using a cookie-cutter approach to offload such "background" jobs to Web Workers. Compute workloads have varied characteristics, some tasks are latency sensitive while some can function better in a consistent level of performance for prolonged periods of time. To satisfy tasks with different performance expectations, modern CPUs incorporate a hybrid architecture with high-performance and high-efficiency cores. Operating systems have APIs to control a thread's Quality of Service (QoS). Under the hood, hardware schedulering tools look at various performance monitoring units and give hints to the Operating System which makes the decision to deploy the task to a performance core or an efficiency core.

We propose introducing a quality of service attribute to the Web Workers so that applications and libraries have a way to explicitly label a workerâ€™s preference of performance. User Agents can take this hint to configure platform thread and possibly affect the scheduling policy.

Windows 11 introduced [EcoQoS](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/performance-diagnostics/introducing-ecoqos/) which is valuable for workloads that do not have a significant performance or responsiveness latency requirement. Developers can set Power throttling properties on threads using the [SetThreadInformation()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-setthreadinformation#remarks) API to control a thread's quality of service (QoS) and enable them to always run in an energy efficient manner. Apple [suggests](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/tuning-your-code-s-performance-for-apple-silicon#Assign-Quality-of-Service-(QoS)-Classes-to-Work) MacOS developers to use the new `setQualityOfService` API instead of thread priority and scheduling parameters. Linux introduced an [energy aware scheduler (EAS)](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/scheduler/sched-energy.rst) for heterogeneous processors to schedule the threads to a most efficient core.

## Goals
The goal is to allow a Web Worker the means to specify a quality of service hint, which specifies how the compute workload should be run.

## Non-goals
We do not want to manage the overall scheduling priority or influence any user-space scheduler. [Prioritized Task Scheduling](https://wicg.github.io/scheduling-apis/) is better suited for scheduling asynchronous tasks within the thread, and to make sure developers don't use the frame budget to keep their apps responsive.

We do not want to influence I/O-bound tasks or any other resource loading optimizations browsers do according to their heuristics priority. [Priority Hints](https://wicg.github.io/priority-hints/) is better suited to signal fetch priorities.

## User research
Multiple stakeholders confirmed they would like an option to offload some of the background processing web worker workload to efficient cores to meet their power budgets. 
Experiments shows that utilizing efficient scheduling would have significant power saving on heavy-loaded background workers, including AI pre-processing in web real-time communication.

## API

```idl
partial dictionary WorkerOptions {
  WorkerQualityOfService qualityOfService = "default";
};

enum WorkerQualityOfService { "high", "low", "default" };
```

When the user agent creates the corresponding native threads for the web workers, also set the quality of service or call related platform interface according to the hint given.
The quality of service attribute of a worker will be decided by the parameter that construct the worker instance and is not affected by its parent worker if it has one.
The quality of service attribute should not affect the worker's platform thread priority, to avoid priority inversion and other scheduling issues.

For worker threads which demand high performance, responsiveness, or sensitive to latency, use `qualityOfService: 'high'`. This will hint the platform that the worker thread can be scheduled or optimized for best performance.
```js
let worker = new Worker('worker.js', { qualityOfService: 'high' });
```

For worker threads which do not demand performance, responsiveness and are **NOT** sensitive to latency, or expect its runtime energy efficiency, use `qualityOfService: 'low'`. This will hint the platform that the worker thread can be scheduled or optimized for best efficiency.
```js
let worker = new Worker('worker.js', { qualityOfService: 'low' });
```

If prioritizing performance or efficiency is not necessary for the worker thread, it is recommended to use the option `qualityOfService: 'default'`. This option instruct the platform to use default settings for the worker thread. The final behavior of the thread will be determined by performance-efficiency policies of the user agent, like efficiency mode in the Edge, as well as platform power and thermal throttling policies, which will take into account factors such as system power saving mode, power status, and battery percentage.
```js
let worker = new Worker('worker.js', { qualityOfService: 'default' });
```

If `qualityOfService` is `undefined` or other values, it would be interpreted as `'default'`, in which case user agents should use a system default setting.

## Key scenarios
Tasks on web workers are usually time consuming and not sensitive to responsiveness. Tagging these workers as "low" quality of service will prevent them from competing for computing resources with other threads and will possibly improve the power efficiency for running those tasks. Examples are:
- Data prefetching and preprocessing
- Caching and local storage management
- Compressing and data integrity validation
- Spell check

Some work may be responsible of providing the user with a real-time result, where a "high" quality of service hint would instruct the platform to provide the best performance and responsiveness. Such as:
- Audio processing in real-time communication

## Performance
Here are some example showing "low" quality of service would really help improving the power efficiency while not affecting the overall performance.
We implemented a demo on the Chromium project, using Windows's SetThreadInformation API to adjust PowerThrottling settings. Below are some test results based on Intel Core i7-1255U / 16GB RAM / Windows 11 21H2. Due to some reasons, only relative values are provided.

### Background blur for online conference
Zoom is a comprehensive communication platform offering high-quality video conferencing, online meetings, and group chat, with a background blur feature that enhances privacy and minimizes distractions. We use [Zoom web app](https://app.zoom.us/wc) to do 1:1 call with background blur enabled as our test workload. In this scenario, there are video recording, encoding, decoding, and data transmission happening on CPUs. And the background blur uses web worker.

When we turn on the `qualityOfService: low`, we see the latency / jitter / packet loss / resolution(720p) / FPS still remains the same, which indicates the user experience is not affected. We also measured the power consumption between the options. As is shown in Figure 1, the `qualityOfService: low` provides >20% power saving to the video conferencing workload.

![Figure 1. Power consumption of Zoom 1:1 online conference with background blur enabled](https://github.com/riju/web-worker-quality-of-service/assets/89496158/6d259ba3-b2e1-4f59-aaf0-402b33738792)

### Physics engine
For the WASM workload, we use ammo.js, which is a powerful physics engine originally written in C++, compiled to WebAssembly (WASM), enabling high-performance physics simulations for web applications.
We use [ammo.js benchmark with WASM backend](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/blob/main/examples/webgl_demo/ammo.wasm.html), use the default number of boxes 500.

When we turn on the `qualityOfService: low`, the stable FPS still remains at 60 FPS, and we have seen >10% power saving, as is shown in Figure 2.

![Figure 2. Power consumption of ammo.js benchmark (WASM, 500boxes)](https://github.com/riju/web-worker-quality-of-service/assets/89496158/5716876c-8999-45da-aefc-b48eb80d186f)


## Detailed design discussion
- Do we need to change the `qualityOfService` attribute while the task is ongoing?
  - Will there be a performance issue?
- Do we need getter, setter, and an onchange event?

## Considered alternatives

### [Worklet](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/worklets.html)
According to the [HTML Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/worklets.html):
> The worklet infrastructure specified here cannot be used directly by web developers. Instead, other specifications build upon it to create directly-usable worklet types, specialized for running in particular parts of the browser implementation pipeline.

> Worklets are similar to web workers. However, they:
> - Are thread-agnostic. That is, they are not designed to run on a dedicated separate thread, like each worker is. Implementations can run worklets wherever they choose (including on the main thread). 

Worklets are:
1) for limited specific purpose (audio processing, css painting, animation, and layout), in which case web browsers can optimize the thread with sufficient informations and assumptions, and developers are not supposed to affect the procedure, and
2) not binded to specific threads, which makes it hard to hint an uncertain and implementation-defined thread, or do the final decision using multiple hints.

So we think Worklets should not have a quality of service hint and can be optimized with web browsers' effort.

### [Prioritized Task Scheduling](https://wicg.github.io/scheduling-apis/) for JS main thread
[Prioritized Task Scheduling](https://wicg.github.io/scheduling-apis/) is a good way to yield to the browser and ensure the application's responsiveness. Our focus is to deal with the Web Workers that work on the background as a separate thread.

### HTML [Priority Hints](https://wicg.github.io/priority-hints/)
[Priority Hints](https://wicg.github.io/priority-hints/) is a HTML attribute to signal the user agent with priorities for fetching and I/O bound works. We want to focus on the compute bound work done by Web Workers.

### Platform thread priority hints
We are intended to avoid introducing the platform thread priority hint as an alternative or along with the quality of service hint, due to following reasons:
- In repesct of our performance/efficiency target, the platform thread priority is not necessary.
- Letting javascript control the platform thread priority may have permission risks.
- If we do so, whether we should or not, and how to define the priority for nesting workers would be a problem.
