## Introduction
[Web Workers](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html#workers) brought multithreading to browsers. To keep the UI smooth and responsive, any compute-intensive workload should not be handled on the main (rendering) thread. Till now, we have been using a cookie-cutter approach to offload such "background" jobs to Web Workers. Compute workloads have varied characteristics, some tasks are latency sensitive while some can function better in a consistent level of performance for prolonged periods of time. To satisfy tasks with different performance expectations, modern CPUs incorporate a hybrid architecture with high-performance and high-efficiency cores. Operating systems have APIs to control a thread's Quality of Service (QoS). Under the hood, hardware schedulering tools look at various performance monitoring units and give hints to the Operating System which makes the decision to deploy the task to a performance core or an efficiency core.

We propose introducing a latency sensitive hint attribute to the Web Workers so that applications and libraries have a way to explicitly label a workerâ€™s preference. User Agents can take this hint to configure platform thread and possibly affect the scheduling policy.

Windows 11 introduced [EcoQoS](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/performance-diagnostics/introducing-ecoqos/) which is valuable for workloads that do not have a significant performance or latency requirement. Developers can set Power throttling properties on threads using the [SetThreadInformation()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-setthreadinformation#remarks) API to control a thread's quality of service (QoS) and enable them to always run in an energy efficient manner. Apple [suggests](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/tuning-your-code-s-performance-for-apple-silicon#Assign-Quality-of-Service-(QoS)-Classes-to-Work) MacOS developers to use the new `setQualityOfService` API instead of thread priority and scheduling parameters. Linux introduced an [energy aware scheduler (EAS)](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/scheduler/sched-energy.rst) for heterogeneous processors to schedule the threads to a most efficient core.

## Goals
The goal is to allow a Web Worker the means to specify a hint if the compute workload they are supposed to perform is latency sensitive or not.

## Non-goals
We do not want to manage the overall scheduling priority or influence any userspace scheduler. [Prioritized Task Scheduling](https://wicg.github.io/scheduling-apis/) is better suited to make sure developers don't use the frame budget to keep their apps responsive.

We do not want to influence I/O-bound tasks or any other resource loading optimizations browsers do according to their heuristics priority. [Priority Hints](https://wicg.github.io/priority-hints/) is better suited to signal fetch priorities.

## User research
Multiple stakeholders confirmed they would like to offload some of the background processing in the Workers to Efficient Cores to meet their power budgets. 
Experiments shows that utilizing efficient scheduling would have significant power saving on heavy-loaded background workers, such as AI pre-processing in web real-time communication.

## API
When the user agent creates the corresponding native threads for the web workers, also set the quality of service or similar interface according to the hint given.
The latency sensitive attribute of a worker is only decided by the parameter that construct the instance and is not affected by its parent worker if it has one.
The latency sensitive attribute should not affect the worker's platform thread priority, to avoid priority inversion and other scheduling issues.

For worker threads which demand high responsiveness and are sensitive to latency, use ```latencySensitive: 'high'```. This will provide a hint to the underlying system that this Worker can be run on an core which prioritizes Performance.

```js
let worker = new Worker('worker.js', { latencySensitive: 'high'});
```

For worker threads which do not demand high responsiveness and are **NOT** sensitive to latency, use ```latencySensitive: 'low'```. This will provide a hint to the underlying system that this Worker can be run on an core which prioritizes Efficiency.

```js
let worker = new Worker('worker.js', { latencySensitive: 'low'});
```
Sometimes we are not confident about the exact latency sensitivity of the workload. Our guidance is to use ```latencySensitive: 'default'```. This will provide a hint to the underlying system that this Worker does not actually have a preference. User Agents can use their policy like EfficiencyMode (used in Edge) and other factors on power and thermal throttling (system on power saving mode, plugged in or in battery, etc) to determine the default behaviour.


```js
let worker = new Worker('worker.js', { latencySensitive: 'default'});
```

If `latencySensitive` is `undefined` or other values, it would be interpreted as `'default'`, in which case user agents should use a system default setting.


## Key scenarios
Tasks on web workers are usually time consuming and not latency sensitive. Tagging these workers as "low" latency sensitivity will prevent them from competing for computing resources with other threads and will possibly improve the power efficiency of running those tasks. Such as:
- Data prefetching and preprocessing
- Caching and local storage
- Compressing and data integrity validation
- Spell check

Some work may provide the user with a real-time result, where a "high" latency sensitivity tag would indicate the platform to provide the best performance and the shortest latency despite platform default configuration. Such as:
- Audio processing in real-time communication



## Detailed design discussion
- Do we need to change the ```latencySensivity``` attribute while the task is ongoing ?
- Do we need getter / setter or an onAttributeChange() event to signal the changes ?
- Would the cost of switching tasks midway to different cores affect performance.

## Considered alternatives

### [Prioritized Task Scheduling](https://wicg.github.io/scheduling-apis/) for JS main thread
[Prioritized Task Scheduling](https://wicg.github.io/scheduling-apis/) is a good way to yield to the browser and ensure the application's responsiveness. Our focus is to deal with the Web Workers that work on the background as a separate thread.

### HTML [Priority Hints](https://wicg.github.io/priority-hints/)
[Priority Hints](https://wicg.github.io/priority-hints/) is a HTML attribute to signal the user agent with priorities for fetching and I/O bound works. We want to focus on the compute bound work done by Web Workers.

### Platform thread priority hints
We are intended to avoid introducing the platform thread priority hint as an alternative or along with the latency sensitive hint, due to following reasons:
- In repesct of our performance/efficiency target, the platform thread priority is not necessary.
- Letting javascript control the platform thread priority may have permission risks.
- If we do so, whether we should or not, and how to define the priority for nesting workers would be a problem.
